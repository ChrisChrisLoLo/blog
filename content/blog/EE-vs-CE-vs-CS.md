## *Disclaimer*
The point of this article is to give personal insight about a topic that often confuses a lot of people. While I have no agenda to push, my personal experiences bias me towards having certain opinions.

When making choices as large as choosing your degree, be sure to get as many opinions as you can before committing to something.

## Introduction
![Confused face](/blog/images/EE-vs-CE-vs-CS/1.png)

There often is a lot of confusion about the differences between Computer Engineering and Computer Science. In this post I will explain the differences between the two in a unopinionated overview, give the opinionated pros and cons of each, and provide biased recommendations based on anecdotes and experiences.

Note that this article will become increasingly biased and opinionated, so I strongly recommend talking to other people about the points I'll raise here. This article will also primarily focus on programs at the UofA, and may be less applicable to other universities.

## So what's the big difference?

The main difference between, Computer Engineering (CE), and Computer Science (CS) is primarily the hardware to software ratio that each program focuses on. Computer Science will focus mostly on software (algorithms, programming, software engineering), and Computer Engineering will have a split between software courses as well as some Electrical Engineering courses. These Electrical Engineering courses range from working with digital logic, to circuits, to signal processing.

Generally speaking, CS is good if you want to get into software development, and CE is good if you want to either do software development or work with embedded systems (which is vaguely akin to programming electronics).

If this difference sounds dry, it's because that's as much as I can explain without making a bunch of assumptions and maybe stepping on some toes.

## Pros and Cons

So assuming that your goal is to get employed and do something you don't hate, what's the trade off with each program?

### Computer Engineering
Computer engineering gives you a bit of flexibility, as it's easier to work with embedded systems with a CE background. That being said, CE generally harder than CS, and if you know you don't like circuits or hardware, you will be "wasting" some of your classes working with circuits and signals rather than fleshing out your CS background.
#### Pros
- You can gain the ability to work with oscilloscopes and be able to debug hardware. This is a must if you want to work with embedded systems.
- At the UofA, there is a co-op program, though this program is competitive
- As of late, it is easier to get into Engineering than Science if you're coming from highschool (lower admission averages)
- In my opinion, it's easier to surround yourself with career oriented individuals since the co-op program forces individuals to learn how to secure a position early on.
#### Cons
- You will take 6 courses instead of 5. This means less time to focus on prepping for interviews or to make new projects. It's by no means impossible, but there's generally more stress when trying to actively balance school with other priorities.
- There's generally less room for options here, since in some ways you're taking a CS and EE double major.
#### Notes
- Is generally _not_ more prestigious than CS in the eyes of hiring companies. In my experience, there are much bigger factors to securing a job (like GPA or projects) than just the name of your program.
- Math heavy since this has EE courses. If you dislike Calculus or continuous math in general, consider going into CS
